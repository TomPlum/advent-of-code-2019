The trick is to use a combination of depth first search first to find all relevant weighted paths to nearest keys and
Dijkstra to find the final minimum path.

Okay, what do we know?

- We need to find every possible combination of paths/order in which you collect the keys.

Performance Issues
- Introduce Cache: Each time you find a key, check the cache for an existing path.
- Can we not just graph all the weights between all the keys once at the start? Then traverse this graph?
- The cache is currently not working because the accessibleKeys function is adding the source key to the collectedKeys.
  This means that there is is always a single key (The source key) different when checking key equality in the cache.

New Solution:
- Pre-compute all key->key weighting w/blocking doors and passed keys, store in graph w/adjacency lists.
- Use Dijkstra's algorithms tracking current key and keys collected to find the shortest path.

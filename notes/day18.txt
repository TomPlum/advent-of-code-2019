The trick is to use a combination of depth first search first to find all relevant weighted paths to nearest keys and
Dijkstra to find the final minimum path.

Okay, what do we know?

- We need to find every possible combination of paths/order in which you collect the keys.

Performance Issues
- Introduce Cache: Each time you find a key, check the cache for an existing path.
- Can we not just graph all the weights between all the keys once at the start? Then traverse this graph?
